Securecom Messaging
===================

A secure messaging application for Android. It provides:

1. *Local Encryption* -- All text messages, regardless of destination, that are sent or received with Securecom Messaging are stored in an encrypted database on your phone.
2. *Wire Encryption* -- When communicating with a recipient who is also using Securecom Messaging, text messages are encrypted during transmission.

This project is based on TextSecure from Open WhisperSystems. Securecom Messaging has the following unique features:

1. Push messaging/data only. SMS and MMS support is completely removed. We have created a separate app to support SMS and MMS.
2. The use of email addresses for identity is supported in addition to phone numbers. Conversations between users with email addresses or phone numbers is supported.
3. Devices without telephony, such as tablets, are supported.
4. Blackberry devices are supported
5. By default, Securecom Messaging registers with a server operated by Securecom
